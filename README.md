# Time_tracker

## Description
Time\_tracker is a roleplaying game tool to help Dungeon Masters / Story Tellers you keep track of a bunch of in-game stuff. Note that Time\_tracker is (at least for now) specific to the Forgotten Realms setting for Dungeons and Dragons. It tracks dates according to the Calendar of Harptos and illustrates the phases of Selûne.
