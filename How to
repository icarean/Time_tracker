Requires: MapTool 1.11 or later (wherein Add-on Libraries were implemented).
Developed in: MapTool 1.14.rc4 on Ubuntu 23.10
How to install: Drag and drop the .mtlib file from your file explorer onto the MapTool map, then follow the instructions in the Read Me which pops up.

Bug reports and suggestions welcome.



The .sh file runs a Bash (Linux) script to: 
 1. ZIP all files/directories
 2. Change extension to .mtlib
 3. Remove old addon, add new addon
 
One day I'll make a .bat (Windows) batch file to do the same. Sorry, today is not that day.
