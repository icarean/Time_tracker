<h1>Time tracker for MapTool</h1>
<br />
This Read Me can be re-read in MapTool at any time:
<ol>
<li>Go to File -> 'Add On Libraries'.</li>
<li>Select Time_tracker from the list of add-ons.</li>
<li>Click the Read Me button.</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>DMs deserve nice things. Time_tracker is designed to help you keep track of a bunch of in-game stuff to make your life easier. Your players are having enough fun. It's ok for DMs to have nice things. A few things to note...</p>
<ul>
  <li>The time tracker is (at least for now) specific to the Forgotten Realms setting for Dungeons and Dragons. It tracks dates according to the Calendar of Harptos and illustrates the phases of Selûne.</li>
  <li>Use this resource to help ease the DM info-tracking workload, and perhaps to bolster a description when creative energy is in a lull. Please don't consider this resource as something intended to limit your DMing in any way. For example, the time tracker plots moon cycles, but if you story calls for a dark night with a new moon then just fudge and/or hand-wave it as needed to tell your story.</li>
  <li>I've implemented a clock with hours and minutes, but this isn't the typical way residents of Faerûn would tell the time. The clock is more for the behind-the-scenes use of the DM, and for the convenience of measuring the passing of time in hours such as for short and long rests.</li>
  <li>The time tracker represents sun and moon rise/set cycles and moon phases, assuming are the viewer is looking towards the south from the northern hemisphere (e.g. on the Sword Coast). The viewer has a very wide angle >180-degree lens, so the left side of the screen roughly represents 'east' and the right side of the screen roughly represents 'west', but all of this is <b>only</b> a visual representation/approximation, <u>not</u> a 3D simulation.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
<h2>Using the time tracker</h2>
<p>When you first added the Time_tracker Add-on Library, a token was created (the words "Time_tracker" over a crescent moon). If you haven't already done so, select that token and go to Window -> Selected. You'll see some macro buttons in the 'Selected' dock (this is on the right side of the screen in my set-up, but might be elsewhere for you). Go to Window -> Campaign. You'll see a 'Campaign' dock, which is where campaign-wide macros can go. You should be able to drag and drop the macros from the Selected pane to the Campaign pane.<p>
<p>Once you've dragged and dropped your macros into the Campaign dock, right click on them, select 'Edit', go to the 'Details' tab, and change the 'Hot Key' setting to something suitable to allow quick and easy access throughout your gaming.</p>
<p>Once the macros are in the Campaign dock, there is no further need for the Time_tracker_macros token. You can delete that token.</p>
<p>If you need to run the setup process again, resetting the Time_tracker to its default settings and recreating the Time_tracker_macros token, you can do so by copy/pasting the following into the chat window: <pre>[macro("onFirstInit@lib:icarean.0001.Time_tracker"):""]</pre></p>
<p>If you need to manually alter the settings (e.g. to jump the tracker to a distant year), you can do so by copy/pasting the following into the chat window: (replacing YOURYEAR, YOURDAY, and YOURTIME with your preferred numbers)
<ul>
<li><pre>[setLibProperty("currentYear", YOURYEAR, "lib:icarean.0001.Time_tracker"):""]</pre></li>
<li><pre>[setLibProperty("currentDay", YOURDAY, "lib:icarean.0001.Time_tracker"):""]</pre></li>
<li><pre>[setLibProperty("currentTime", YOURTIME, "lib:icarean.0001.Time_tracker"):""]</pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version history</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>This version: </b>Basic UI rework, adding the ability to increase year/month/day/time by arbitrary amounts. Calendar view now minimally functional (can view the current year).</li>
  <li><b>0.41.20251120: </b>Fix library functionality for MapTool 1.18.x.</li>
  <li><b>0.4.20231125: </b>Switched to Add On Library to simplify installation. Settings macro to select 12/24h time display.</li>
  <li><b>0.4.20231104: </b>First release.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
<h2>Known bugs/issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing the month just adds 30 days, so the day-of-month changes in a counter-intuitive way when there are extra days (festivals) between the months. I'm not certain whether longer term I'll leave things this way or change it to try to maintain day-of-month.</li>
  <li>Updating the current day in the time tracker view doesn't update the highlighted day in the calendar view.</li>
  <li>Areas of the time tracker are selectable in ways that undermines UI joy (e.g. double-clicking on the hills image highlights that image).</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
<h2>Planned to-dos</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking for sleep/rest and other timed events. (will likely be v0.6)</li>
  <li>Dawn/dusk time change with seasons. (will likely be v0.7)</li>
  <li>Time of day names implemented from https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hours_of_the_day (will likely be v0.7)</li>
  <li>Settings screen to allow user to change font sizes. (will likely be v0.8)</li>
  <li>Enable frame resizing.  (will likely be v0.8)</li>
  <li>Make an overlay banner instead of a frame (and smaller) (suggestion from aliasmask). (will look at with v0.8)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible future dreams which may or may not eventuate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upcoming events calendar. Start with equinox events listed in https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Calendar_of_Harptos</li>
  <li>Tides (e.g. https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Los-Angeles-California/tides/latest ).</li>
  <li>Ability to make a note of events that occur.</li>
  <li>Maybe weather able to be generated and recorded?</li>
  <li>Things such as weather and perhaps recording when visited linked to maps?</li>
  <li>Ability to have user-definable worlds rather than being stuck with hard-coded northern hemisphere Faerûn. This could include the ability to modify the compass, set custom sun and moon cycles and trajectories, set custom moon/sun z-index, use custom sun/moon images, and have the potential for multiple suns and/or moons.</li>
  <li>A selection of different terrain images for various biomes (grass, desert, snow, ocean, mountain).</li>
</ul>
